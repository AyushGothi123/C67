T here was a village on the outskirts of a forest. A shepherd boy used to take his herd of sheep across the fields to the lawns near the forest.
One day he felt very boring. He wanted to have fun. So he cried aloud "Wolf, Wolf. The wolf is carrying away a lamb". Farmers working in the fields came running and asked, "Where is the wolf?". The boy laughed and replied "It was just a fun. Now get going all of you".
